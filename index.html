                    <p>I'm a web developer (with an eye for design), a puzzle solver who loves nothing better than finding an elegant solution to a sticky problem. </p>
                    <p>Most of my development during 2015 has been in <strong>WordPress,</strong> with all the <strong>PHP, HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> that comes with building a custom site. Currently, I'm learning to build websites using <strong>Sass</strong> and <strong>Foundation,</strong> working on the front end of a web app that's chock-a-block with forms, and continuing to strengthen my core JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>A responsive <strong>WordPress</strong> site built for Criminal Defense Attorney James Kousouros. Designed by <a class="semiLink" href="http://donnaagajanian.dphoto.com/#/album/f9e2fw" target="_blank">Donna Agajanian,</a> the site was completely customized using <strong>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, JavaScript,</strong> and <strong>jQuery.</strong></p>
                        <p>With WordPress, I was able to deliver a site that the client could maintain and add to without having to call a developer for every little thing.</p>

                        <p>Final project for the <strong>General Assembly Web Development Immersive</strong> (an intensive 13-week, 80-hours-per-week course, which I completed in October 2014). </p>
                        <p>Conceived and built solo in 11 days, Wild Diner's content is user-generated—a site for food foragers to share their finds. It is built with <strong>Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, JavaScript</strong> and <strong>jQuery.</strong></p>
                        <p>The new challenge of the project was learning to consume the <strong>Javascript GoogleMaps API.</strong> The map is pinned with locations from the database (which is seeded with data around upstate New York). When a pin is clicked, a modal pops up with information about that particular event.</p>
